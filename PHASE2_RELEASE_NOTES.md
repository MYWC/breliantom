# Phase 2 Release Notes

Phase 2 upgrades the Phase 1 foundation into a reusable design system and app chrome.

## Major additions
- Premium responsive Storefront shell
- Desktop + mobile navigation
- Design token system
- Light / Dark / System surface behavior
- Glass, glow, gradient-border and spotlight effects
- Motion utilities with reduced-motion handling
- Form controls and overlays
- Loading and empty states
- UI Lab at `/ui-lab`
- New Home page built from the same component contracts
- UI component barrel exports

## Validation limitation
Dependency installation was unavailable in the build environment, so package-level typecheck/build could not be truthfully reported as successful. Local imports were statically audited and the foundation validator parses successfully.
